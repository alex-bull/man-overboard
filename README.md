# Zaffre Tides - RaceVision (GAME X)
 
RaceVision is a Maven project to represent a boat race (such as the America's Cup).
It visualises incoming data from a serverâ€™s data stream and constantly updates until the stream finishes sending.

### Operation
To start the race, you need to type in the host address (default is localhost). 
Then press confirm and the race will start after the countdown.
